# SegCap: Image Segmentation and Captioning System

## Project Overview
This project implements a system for segmenting images and generating captions for the identified segments. The system uses advanced machine learning models for semantic segmentation and natural language processing (NLP).

**Key Features**
1. Image Segmentation: Segments images into meaningful parts using the Segment Anything Model (SAM).
2. Caption Generation: Uses the BLIP model for generating captions for segmented parts.
3. Full Pipeline: The system processes images, segments them, and then generates descriptive captions for each segment.

## Development Environment Configuration
- **OS:** Linux or Windows
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or newer

## Programming Languages
- **Python**

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository: git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/jesayanthony/SegCap.git)>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd cd SegCap
3. Install required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Compile Commands
No compilation is required, as the project is written in Python. However, you may need to run the main script to process images:
python src/main.py

## Changes to Folder Structure After Compile
After running the scripts, the `output_images/` directory will be populated with the processed images and their corresponding segmentation and captioning results.

## List of Tools Used
- **PyTorch**: For machine learning model operations and neural network processing.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks, such as loading and manipulating images.
- **Matplotlib**: For generating visualizations of the segmented images and their captions.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** - For using pre-trained models like BLIP for image captioning.

## Licenses
- **PyTorch:** BSD-style license
- **OpenCV:** Apache 2 license
- **Matplotlib:** PSF-based license
- **Transformers:** Apache 2.0 license

## Outputs Generated by Tools
1. **Segmentation Model**: Generates masks for various segments in the input images.
2. **Captioning Model**: Uses the segment masks to generate captions describing the identified segments.
The results are stored in the output_images/ directory, where each processed image will have its corresponding segmentation and caption visualization.

## Known Issues
- **Share URL:** The share URL functionality does not always work as expected, potentially due to server or configuration issues.
- **PDF Version:** To print out a PDF version of the entire conversation or documentation, use a standard browser or PDF printer to convert the web page to PDF format.
