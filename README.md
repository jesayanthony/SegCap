# Image Segmentation and Captioning System

## Project Overview
This project implements a system for segmenting images and generating captions for the identified segments. The system uses advanced machine learning models for semantic segmentation and natural language processing.

## Development Environment Configuration
- **OS:** Linux or Windows
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or newer

## Programming Languages
- **Python**

## Project Folder Hierarchy
/project_root/ │ 
├── models/ # Directory to store model weights 
│ ├── input_images/ # Directory containing images to process 
│ ├── output_images/ # Directory to store output images and captions 
│ ├── segmentation.py # Main module for segmentation and captioning tasks 
│ └── main.py # Script to run the full processing pipeline

## Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd project_root
3. Install required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Compile Commands
No compilation is required, as the project is written in Python. However, you may need to run the main script to process images:
python main.py


## Changes to Folder Structure After Compile
After running the scripts, the `output_images/` directory will be populated with the processed images and their corresponding segmentation and captioning results.

## List of Tools Used
- **PyTorch** - For machine learning model operations.
- **OpenCV** - For image processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib** - For generating image visualizations.
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** - For NLP tasks and caption generation.

## Licenses
- **PyTorch:** BSD-style license
- **OpenCV:** Apache 2 license
- **Matplotlib:** PSF-based license
- **Transformers:** Apache 2.0 license

## Outputs Generated by Tools
The segmentation model generates masks for different image segments, which are then used by the captioning model. Input images are transformed into captioned segments, which are visualized and saved in the `output_images/` directory.

## Known Issues
- **Share URL:** The share URL functionality does not always work as expected, potentially due to server or configuration issues.
- **PDF Version:** To print out a PDF version of the entire conversation or documentation, use a standard browser or PDF printer to convert the web page to PDF format.
